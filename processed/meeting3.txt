[2:00 PM] – Neha (Product Manager):
Okay team, thanks for joining. We need to finalize the search feature improvements. The beta release is planned for March 10th, so timelines are tight.

[2:01 PM] – Aditya (Frontend Dev):
Right now, search works, but it’s pretty basic. I’m planning to add debounce and filtering by genre. I can complete that by Thursday.

[2:02 PM] – Neha:
Good. Please make sure it doesn’t affect performance on slower devices.

[2:03 PM] – Isha (Backend Dev):
From backend side, I need to optimize the movie query. It’s currently doing a full text search without indexing. I’ll implement indexing and push changes by Friday evening.

[2:04 PM] – Neha:
Perfect. Coordinate with Aditya before deploying anything to production.

[2:05 PM] – Rahul (QA):
Do we want test cases for edge scenarios like empty queries or special characters?

[2:06 PM] – Neha:
Yes, absolutely. Please prepare a test plan and share it by tomorrow afternoon.

[2:07 PM] – Aditya:
Also, I think we should improve the “No Results Found” state. Maybe add suggestions?

[2:08 PM] – Neha:
That’s a good idea. Can you mock something up?

[2:08 PM] – Aditya:
Yes, I’ll design a few UI options and send them for review by Wednesday.

[2:09 PM] – Isha:
We still haven’t finalized the API rate limits. Should I configure that now?

[2:10 PM] – Neha:
Yes, go ahead and set reasonable limits. Let’s review them next week.

[2:11 PM] – Rahul:
There’s also a bug where pagination breaks after page 5. I need backend support to resolve that.

[2:12 PM] – Isha:
I’ll take a look today and try to fix it before end of day.

[2:13 PM] – Neha:
Thanks. Also, everyone please update documentation as you complete tasks. We need everything ready before beta.

[2:14 PM] – Aditya:
Should we add a “Recently Searched” feature in this sprint?

[2:15 PM] – Neha:
Let’s not commit yet. Prepare a quick feasibility note and we’ll decide in the next meeting.

[2:16 PM] – Rahul:
I’ll start regression testing once the search updates are deployed.

[2:17 PM] – Neha:
Good. Let’s aim to freeze new changes by March 8th.

[2:18 PM] – Isha:
I’ll also monitor server logs after deployment to ensure stability.

[2:19 PM] – Neha:
Perfect. Reminder: send daily progress updates on Slack before 7 PM.

[2:20 PM] – All:
Agreed.

[2:21 PM] – Neha:
Alright, thanks everyone. Let’s reconvene on Friday for a quick status check.
