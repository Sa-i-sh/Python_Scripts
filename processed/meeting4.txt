[11:00 AM] – Riya (Operations Lead):
Let’s get started. Main agenda today is Firebase integration, payment gateway setup, and release readiness. The internal demo is scheduled for March 12th.

[11:01 AM] – Dev (Backend):
Firebase auth is working in dev, but I still need to configure production keys. I’ll handle that today and confirm once done.

[11:02 AM] – Riya:
Please prioritize that. We cannot test payments without proper authentication.

[11:03 AM] – Aman (Mobile Dev):
On the Android side, Google login works, but email login occasionally fails. I need to debug that. Should be able to resolve it by tomorrow evening.

[11:04 AM] – Riya:
Okay. Once fixed, inform QA immediately.

[11:05 AM] – Nisha (QA):
Yes, I’m waiting on stable builds. I’ll start end to end testing as soon as I receive confirmation.

[11:06 AM] – Dev:
About payments, Razorpay integration is partially done. I still need webhook validation logic.

[11:07 AM] – Riya:
When can that be completed?

[11:07 AM] – Dev:
If nothing blocks me, I’ll finish it by Friday afternoon.

[11:08 AM] – Aman:
We also need to update the privacy policy screen before release.

[11:09 AM] – Riya:
Right. Aman, please coordinate with the legal team and get the final content. Let’s not delay that.

[11:10 AM] – Aman:
I’ll reach out to them today and follow up tomorrow if needed.

[11:11 AM] – Nisha:
There’s a pending issue with push notifications not triggering consistently.

[11:12 AM] – Dev:
That might be due to incorrect topic subscription. I’ll review the configuration and share an update by end of day.

[11:13 AM] – Riya:
Good. Also, everyone make sure to update Jira before logging off today.

[11:14 AM] – Aman:
Should we prepare release notes this week?

[11:15 AM] – Riya:
Yes. Draft the release notes by Monday. We’ll review and finalize on Tuesday.

[11:16 AM] – Dev:
Do we want monitoring alerts configured before demo?

[11:17 AM] – Riya:
Definitely. Set up basic crash alerts and email notifications. Complete that before the 10th.

[11:18 AM] – Nisha:
I’ll prepare a checklist for demo readiness and circulate it by Friday.

[11:19 AM] – Riya:
Perfect. Let’s have a quick follow up on Thursday at 3 PM to track progress.

[11:20 AM] – All:
Sounds good.

[11:21 AM] – Riya:
Alright, thanks everyone. Please ensure all blockers are communicated early. Meeting closed.
